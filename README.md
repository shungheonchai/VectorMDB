# MongoDB Movie Vectorization Demo
This code is a modified demo from a [MongoDB Atlas tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/semantic-search-mongodb-atlas-vector-search/). This is using the existing `sample_mflix.embedded_movies` namespace thus significantly reducing the time to setup.

## Prerequisites
All you need are nodeJS, access to a MongoDB cluster with the sample data loaded, and an OpenAI API key.
If you are using a newer version of MacBook Pro's it should come installed with nodeJS but if it didn't use the below code snippets.

```
brew update
```
```
brew install node
```

Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and then fill in the _deleteMe_ section with the OpenAI API key and MongoDB Connection String.

If you haven't created a vector search index on the embedded_movie collection already, create one by using Atlas UI, Compass, or even the Admin API

Finally go to the `vectorMongo.js` file and look for the `"index": "moviePlotVectorIndex"` and replace it with the index name that you created for this 

## How to run it
Use the below terminal command, replacing the words within the quotation marks to whatever you want. Copying and pasting would work as well. 
```
#!/bin/bash

node vectorMongo.js "A boy with a wizard hat"
```
You can change the number of results, the numCandidate value, or extra filters onto the query within the `$vectorSearch` stage within `vectorMongo.js`

## Reading the results
The above would output with the following with the sensitive data redacted. It's followed by the actual 1526 dimension vector embedding of "A boy with a wizard hat" from OpenAI's ada-002 and finally has a list (the default value is 3 but you can change this) of documents that matched the vector including the Vector Score.
